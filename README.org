* Welcome to my Emacs Config
  I really need to come up with a name for this

** What is this?
   This is the repos for my emcas dotfiles. If you don't know what emacs is, it's a "text editor" that's actually a emacs lisp interpreter, meaning it can do pretty much anything

** Why not just use something like Doom Emacs or Spacemacs?
   Those are probably better distributions of Emacs, but I like creating my own configs for stuff mostly from scratch, as I like knowing exactly what's in my configs. Also I wanted to have Remelia on the homepage, and I think others would as well.

** How do I install this
   MAKE SURE TO BACK UP ANY EXISTING EMACS CONFIG. Then simply run the following:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Ocillacubes/Emacs ~/.emacs.d && emacs
   #+END_SRC
   This clones the repo to your ~/.emacs.d directory, which is where your emacs config files go.
** What are the features of this distribution?
*** Current:
- Remilia on the homepage
- Agenda/Recent files on the homepage
- Treemacs
- Gruvbox theme
- Evil mode
- Quit prompts with escape
- Search documents with swiper
- Smart bracket pairing
- Nix config syntax highlighting
- Nice bottom bar
- Remelia quotes on homepage
- Fixed redo
- Eshell
- Copy paste outside emacs
- Start fullscreen
    
*** Planned: 
- Better keybindings
- Make the cursor switch to new buffers when they open
- Come up with a name
- Better documentation
- Move config to .org files
- Music player
- Setup mu4e for mail
- Rss Feeds
